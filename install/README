## to install on a AWS EC2 instance see the EC2/README.ec2
for standard install on linux
I am assumeing you already have the source downloaded and unpacked

as root

cd kea-service/install
python keasrvinstall.py

you can optionally specify one or all of the following port install-location and user

so for example to install on port 8000 in /opt/var as user keasrv
python keasrvinstall.py 8000 /opt/var keasrv

# when the script completes 
# start the service
	/etc/keasrvctl start

# /etc/keasrvctl stop to stop the service
# /etc/keasrvctl status the status of the service
# /etc/keasrvctl restart restart the service
