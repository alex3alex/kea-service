## to install on a AWS EC2 instance see the EC2/README.ec2
for standard install on linux
I am assuming you already have the source down loaded and unpacked
as root

# quick install and server start
cd kea-service/install
python keasrvinstall.py
sudo /etc/init.d/keasrvctl start


##########################
what the install script (keasrvinstall.py) dose

if run without input parameters 
it will install the java service on port 8000
the python service on 8001
it will create a user named keasrv
it will in stall at /var/opt/keasrv

input parameters can be specified in the following order

port: default is 8000
the java service will be installed on this port,
The python service will be installed on this port + 1

install location : default is /var/opt
a user account will be created  in this location
and files needed to run the service are copied into this location

user : default keasrv
a user is created on this system with this name
by default the password for this account is unset
this can be changed by editing the following lines in the script

   # flag to control weather or not a password is set for the user
    self.set_kea_pass = False  ** change this to True
    # the users password if set
    self.kea_pass = 'RunKea4ME' ** enter the desired password here
   
    then rerun the script -- or as root just set the password
    sudo passwd keasrv ** and follow the prompts 
   

the main program control is as follows

    my_inst.userCheck()
    #this line calls a method to verify the script is being run by the root user
    #if not the script prints out a notice to that effect and exits
    
    my_inst.createUser()
    # create the user and install location
    # this line calls the method to create the user account
    # and install directory
    
    my_inst.getResources()
    #this line calls a method to fetch / install all the resources need to make it work
    # it loops through a list of configured resources
    # checks to see if they are installed if not it installs them
    # if you want the force the script to reinstall everything, then run the following
    # sudo userdel -rf keasrv (or the user name you specified at install)
    # this will remove the user from the system and the users files
    # then run the install script again
    
    my_inst.copySrvc()
    # move the files from the source to the install dir
    
    
    my_inst.makeConf()
    # creates the configuration file
    # writes the config parameters for the init script to /etc/kea-service.conf
    # with the following key value pairs
    # these are loaded amd used by the init script located at /etc/init.d/keasrvctl
    KEAHOME=/var/opt/keasrv               # the installed path
	KEAJARS=kea-5.0_full				  # the sud dir int the install dir where the java class can be found
	KEAMODEL=kea-5.0-default_model        # the name of the model to load at run time
	JAVASRV=patch.main.KEAServer		  # the java class to start
	JVPORT=8000							  # the port the java server will listen on
	PYPORT=8001							  # the port the python wrapper will listen on
	JAVALOG=/var/log/kea-service_jv.log   # the output of the java server will be logged here
	PYSERV=python-server-wrapper.py       # the name of the python wrapper script
	PYLOG=/var/log/kea-service_py.log     # the output of the python wrapper -- if any will be logged here
	JAVA_RUN=/var/run/keasrv_jv.pid       # the pid of the running java process is stored here
	PY_RUN=/var/run/keasrv_py.pid	      # the pid of the running python process is stored here
	SRVUSER=keasrv						  # the user name the service is running as
	
    
    
    my_inst.instInitScript()
    # install the init scripts
    # copy the init script (keasrvctl) to /etc/init.d/keasrvctl
    # create links in the current run level dir for starting and stopping
    # the service at boot / reboot time
    	/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99Keasrv
    	/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/K99Keasrv
    	
    # the script finishes by printing a few helpfull peases of information
